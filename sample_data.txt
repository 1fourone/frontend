    Topics included: Lists, Strings, Conditionals, For Loops.
    Difficulty can be 1 (easy), 2 (medium), or 3 (hard)
    Some "created" at different times than others.

    These represent a question that is in the question bank.
    These can be "recycled" between exams.

No exam questions as of now.
    An exam is made up of exam questions.
    Exam questions can appear on different exams.
    The 'eqid' represents the exam's ID (that is different uuid with same eqid are different questions in the same exam)

No exam answers as of now.
    An exam submission is made up of exam answers.
    Exam submissions are unique to a specific student.
        This is why each exam answer has studentID to point to the student that answer this question.
        All exam answers with the same uuid but different eqid and the same studentID represent all students answers on exam uuid.
    Professor feedback can be null and is a small comment that professor can make on top of the original auto feedback (which cannot be null).
    Auto feedback is done by middle, and it is meant to go into the autoFeedback field.
    Status refers to the 3 status an exam answer(s) (submission) can have:
        - 0: past released exam (student can view)
        - 1: past unreleased exam (student CANNOT view)
        - 2: active exam (student must take exam now)

    NOTE: once an exam is created, it is made up of exam questions as said before. 
          professor pushes it to every student in a class, and each of those students therefore has
          an exam answer for each exam question with the status set to 2 and other default values.
          Once the student hits "submit" on their end, the values are then populated.
